-- Instructions: Replace 'YOUR_USER_ID_HERE' with the actual UUID of the user you want to make an admin
-- You can get the user ID by signing up first, then checking the auth.users table
-- For initial setup, you may need to manually run this after your first signup

-- Example: INSERT INTO public.admin_users (id) VALUES ('YOUR_USER_ID_HERE');

-- This is a template script - after you sign up, update this with your user ID and run it
